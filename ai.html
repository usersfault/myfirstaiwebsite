    <h2>🌍 My Perspective on AI</h2>
    <p>
      AI isn't just a tech buzzword — for me, it's a partner in thinking. I see AI as an amplifier for human creativity, speed, and learning. It’s not here to replace curiosity, but to **extend it**.
      <br><br>
      I'm not here just to “use” AI. I’m here to **understand** it — how it works, how it reasons, and how it changes the way we learn and solve problems.
    </p>

    <h2>🧠 How I Use AI</h2>
    <p>
      I use AI almost daily. Here's what I'm doing with it so far:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Bug Bounty:</strong> I ask AI to explain HTTP requests, payloads, cookie/session behavior, and how JSON APIs work</li>
      <li><strong>Linux Learning:</strong> I use AI to decode terminal tools, permissions, Nmap scans, and hardening methods</li>
      <li><strong>Computer Networking:</strong> I ask about OSI layers, scanning techniques, proxy chains, DNS, and even packet behavior</li>
      <li><strong>English Speaking:</strong> I talk to AI to practice fluency, get feedback, and build sentence confidence</li>
      <li><strong>Project Building:</strong> I use AI to generate starter code, structure my notes, and even help build this website!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🛠️ Tools & Concepts I Explored</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> for breaking down complex topics and helping with real-time ideas</li>
      <li><strong>Sora (video AI):</strong> I discovered how video generation tools can be used for storytelling, education, or simulation</li>
      <li><strong>AI in Cybersecurity:</strong> I’ve learned how AI is used in malware detection, phishing prevention, and even automated recon</li>
      <li><strong>Prompt Engineering:</strong> I’m learning how to talk to AI better by structuring smarter questions and giving context</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🚀 Why I Think AI Matters in the Future</h2>
    <p>
      AI will be part of everything — whether you’re hacking, teaching, coding, or building products. But here’s the difference:
      <br><br>
      > Those who understand how AI works will shape it.  
      > Those who don’t will just consume it.
      <br><br>
      I want to be someone who **shapes it**, or at least **guides it with purpose**.
    </p>

    <h2>📌 What's Next in My AI Journey</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Learn how large language models (LLMs) like GPT actually work</li>
      <li>Use AI to automate repetitive cybersecurity tasks</li>
      <li>Build an AI assistant that summarizes bug bounty reports</li>
      <li>Create content using AI that teaches others what I’m learning</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🧠 One Quote That Feels True to Me</h2>
    <blockquote>
      “AI won’t replace you. But someone using AI might.”  
      <br>– Unknown
