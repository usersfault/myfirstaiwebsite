    <h2>👋 Hey there, I’m Ayush</h2>
    <p>
      I’m not just learning tech — I’m building a mindset around it.
      I started this website to track my learning journey across Linux, Networking, Cybersecurity, AI, and everything that shapes the future.
      I believe technology isn't just tools and code. It’s also **philosophy** — how we think, act, and evolve with machines.
    </p>

    <h2>💡 What Drives Me</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I’m curious — I always want to know how things work under the hood</li>
      <li>I believe in self-learning, and using the internet to grow without waiting for permission</li>
      <li>I enjoy documenting what I learn so others can benefit from it too</li>
      <li>I see AI not just as a tool, but as a way to enhance how we learn, speak, build, and think</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🧠 My Areas of Focus</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>🔐 Cybersecurity & Bug Bounty Hunting</li>
      <li>🐧 Linux Internals & Hardening</li>
      <li>🌐 Networking & Protocols</li>
      <li>🤖 AI + Automation for hacking & productivity</li>
      <li>📚 Communication, mindset, and teaching what I learn</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🛠️ Skills I'm Building</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Working with Linux tools and terminal fluently</li>
      <li>Using Nmap, Netcat, SSH, and dig in real setups</li>
      <li>Understanding JSON, HTTP requests/responses, and sessions</li>
      <li>Exploring AI in cybersecurity automation and education</li>
      <li>Becoming more confident in English speaking and writing</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📌 Why This Website Exists</h2>
    <p>
      This website is my notebook, my lab, my public log. I wanted a place that’s not owned by social media, not ruled by likes — just a space that’s fully mine.
      <br><br>
      Here I can write, reflect, and track how I grow — one command, one idea, one realization at a time.
    </p>
